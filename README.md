Code for the paper "Synthesizing Policies That Account For Human Execution Errors Caused By StateAliasing In Markov Decision Processes"

This work is about computing policies for human agents acting in MDPs by accounting for the kind of errors humans make while acting. This work is limited to discrete state and action space setting. Please see the paper in the repository for more details

To run the code, see the Readme.txt
